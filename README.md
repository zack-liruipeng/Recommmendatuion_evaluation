# Recommmendation_evaluation
In this paper, we presented an experiment for benchmarking best recommender algorithm(s) that can predict users' interest in movies. 
Our study shows that it is difficult to say which recommender algorithm provides the best recommendation. However, we can claim that the SVD++ provided more valuable and appropriate relative to the preferences on top of the list and will help users to make good decisions, while user-centered recommender systems have the ability to predict with better overall accuracy. 
There is no evidence to say which algorithm has the best quality. In addition, the MovieTweetings dataset can achieve better overall accuracy than MovieLens datasets while it did not perform well in other evaluation categories. The experiment also showed that unmodified datasets would cause lack of memory space and suspend the RiVal toolkit. Therefore, unfiltered datasets should be avoided in similar evaluations.
